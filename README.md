# REST-API_Documentation_with_OpenAPI_3

This project shows the documentation of REST_APIs by using OpenApi_3 specification.

During this project I have used the Ticket Booking REST-API which I have created earlier you can find [here](https://github.com/Nitesh232/REST-API_For_Ticket_Booking) .


REST documentation can be found to URL : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
